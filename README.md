# CS 279 Programming HW1

This repo contains the code for a basic To Do App website made with Node.js and MongoDB. 

On this To Do App website, users can create and complete (delete) tasks which are added to a To Do List. This site also has the additional functionalities of being able to delete tasks and edit them after creation. All tasks are stored in a database using MongoDB, so the tasks remain on the site even after closing and reopening or refreshing the page.

The final site can be accessed here: https://todo-app-nodemongo.herokuapp.com/
